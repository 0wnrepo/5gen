# 3DNF example for 16-bit using the GGH mmap, lambda = 20

# This example will produce three ciphertexts in database/, and then run an eval 
# on them to determine the output of the 3DNF function.

LAMBDA=20 # security parameter
BASE=4 # input base representation 
LENGTH=8 # length of inputs
N=8 # max number of plaintexts that can be encrypted
